                The All Terrain Armored Transport is an assault walker used by Imperial ground forces to blast through enemy lines with its sheer mass and firepower and deploy a platoon of crack assault troops.[1][10] The thick armor plating on the AT-AT will deflect or absorb anything but the heaviest turbolaser weaponry.[1] Standing over 22 meters (72 ft) tall,[1][2][10][11] the AT-AT is as much a weapon of terror as anything else, and its mere presence is often enough to intimidate the local populace into obedience.[1][2] Its prodigious height also helps the walker see over obstacles and provides a clear line of sight for its weaponry, carried in its heavily armored head.[1] A pair of Class II heavy laser cannons mounted in the head's "chin" can be fired in quick succession or simultaneously for a single, power blast,[1] and can engage targets from many kilometers away;[12] on either side of the "temples" are mounted medium repeating blasters and targeting rangefinders.[1][10] When it comes time to deploy, troops carried in the AT-AT exit out of the sides via harness-and-cable from extendable boom racks while speeder bikes exit out the front and back using harnesses.[1]  troops carried in the AT-AT exit out of the sides via harness-and-cable from extendable boom racks while speeder bikes exit out the front and back using harnesses.[1] troops carried in the AT-AT exit out of the sides via harness-and-cable from extendable boom racks while speeder bikes exit out the front and back using harnesses.[1] troops carried in the AT-AT exit out of the sides via harness-and-cable from extendable boom racks while speeder bikes exit out the front and back using harnesses.[1]
