                Each engine was fitted with four strong pylons that extended behind to support a long engine nacelle, at the end of which were disk-ventrals that redirected thrust for maneuverability. A pair of thrust control jets were set in the aft central spar to give the Y-wing greater agility. Repulsorlifts were fitted in the neck and wings to provide atmospheric flight. A fuel recycling system gave the Y-wing extreme efficiency during long-range missions.[2] In the event that the craft would have to make a make an emergency landing, the pilot could dump its fuel from the engines.[14]

                    The Y-wing was heavily armored with a titanium-reinforced alusteel hull and a Chempat deflector shield generator. The generator, powered by the ion engines, was linked to shield projectors located across the Y-wing's hull. This allowed the pilot to angle the shields of maximum protection or cover damaged sections of the ship.[2] The Y-wing could also use its cannons to shoot down enemy missiles, so long as the targeting computer remained functional.[15]
